	  	<p>Al Quran is the Holy Book which was sent by Allah to Malak Jibreel to prophet Muhammed (SAW) 
	  	History has unfolded that it was completely descended on the day of Ramadan, At Ahlul Quran we encourage and enforce our student to memoride the Quran as well as its sciences of reading(Tajweed) with the help of our Tutor Sheikh Uthman Abdulai Patty</p>

	  	<img src="Jazari.jpg">
	  	
	  	<p>Jazariyya is a poem that Ibn Al Jazari wrote summarizing the rules of Tajweed. Having ijazah in Tajweed often means that you have studied this text and your teacher has given you permission to teach it to others.
         In the Jazariyyah, Ahlul Quran move beyond the basics and study Tajweed as a science as well as seeing how Tajweed intersects with Arabic grammar and other sciences.</p>

	  	<p>The book is officially titled Hirzal Amani Wawajhatahani  or the Shatibiyyah  written by Imam As-Shatibi, an andalusian scholar of the Quran and it’s sciences. He wrote his book, the Shatibiyyah to make it simple for students of knowledge to learn the 7 Qiraa’aat in a simple poem-format.</p>
